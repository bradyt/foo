* fsbot-view-data
This package provides an interface to the database of fsbot, the
resident bot of the #emacs channel on freenode. Use
~fsbot-download-data~ first, then call ~fsbot-view-data~ to browse the
entire fsbot db, as well as ~fsbot-display-entry~ to search for a
particular entry. While in the browser, you can use
~fsbot-display-entry-at-point~ (bound to RET by default) to display
the entry at point in its own buffer.

fsbot-data-browser is on MELPA and MELPA Stable, under that name. I
recommend the MELPA Stable version, as the master branch is not
necessarily going to work well at all times. (That's what releases are
for).

* Todos
- don't hardcode the local db filename
- fsbot-view-data should kick off a download if the local copy doesn't exist
- should add option to automatically update the fsbot data if it's a certain age
